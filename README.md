# 💖 Port Scanner

A pastel-powered, multi-threaded port scanner built with Python and Tkinter.  
Scan open ports on a target like a pro — all while keeping it soft, aesthetic, and simple. 💅🎀

## ✨ Features
- Multi-threaded fast port scanning
- Beautiful pastel-pink & purple themed GUI
- User-friendly and beginner-safe (error handling included)
- Built with 💗 using Python's `socket`, `threading`, and `tkinter` libraries


## 🛠️ How It Works
1. Enter the **Target Host** (e.g. `127.0.0.1` or domain name).
2. Set the **Start Port** and **End Port** to define your scan range.
3. Hit `🚀 Start Scan` and let the scanner do its thing.

All open ports will show up in a text area below, neatly listed for you.

## 📦 Requirements
- Python 3.x

You don’t need to install any external libraries — it's all standard modules.
